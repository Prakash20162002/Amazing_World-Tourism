                    Kedarnath is a town and Nagar Panchayat in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, India, known
                    primarily for the Kedarnath
                    Temple. It is approximately 86 kilometres from Rudraprayag, the district headquarter. Kedarnath is
                    the most remote of
                    the four Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites. It is located in the Himalayas, about 3,583 m (11,755 ft)
                    above sea level
                    near the Chorabari Glacier, which is the source of the Mandakini river. The town is flanked by
                    snow-capped peaks, most
                    prominently the Kedarnath Mountain. The nearest road head is at Gaurikund about 16 km away. The town
                    suffered extensive
                    destruction during June 2013 from the Flash Floods caused by torrential rains in Uttarakhand
                    state.[4]
